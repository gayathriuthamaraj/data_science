Together we call as\nCSPC or Common Services Platform Collector.CSPC-NOS is an add-on service which is written\non top of the CSPC i.e., extra software written by the Nos team based on the CSPC 2.0 base\ncode to cater to a group of customers. CSPC-NOS support on both Windows and Linux Cent OS\nplatform. The Windows CSPC-NOS client can connect to the CSPC-NOS Linux server and vice-\nversa. Devices can be added manually or using the import seed file. When importing a seed file/\nWhen Device discovery is triggered the Device discovery module collects light inventory data\nfrom the devices. The light inventory data contain information like Sys Object Id, device family,\nOS-version etc. . (This information collected can be seen by going to Reports->Managed Devices)\nThis light inventory data is used by the inventory module to load the model rule for the respective\ndevice. This data is also used by the base collector to decide whether the device is managed\nor unmanaged.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nhttps://www.indeed.com/r/Tejasri-Gunnam/6ef1426c95ee894c?isid=rex-download&ikw=download-top&co=IN\n\n\n➢ Involved Identifying Scenarios to be tested\n➢ Preparing Test Cases\n➢ Executing Test Cases\n➢ Automating Testcases using TCL scripting\n➢ Preparing Progress Report for Sign Off\n➢ Test Plan\n➢ Traceability Matrix\n➢ Order Progression\n➢ Raising and reporting defects to dev team\n➢ Defect Management on monthly basis\n➢ Participated in Defect prevention meetings on quarterly basis to reduce defect density.\nSecurity Testing:\n➢ Threat Modelling\n➢ Gap Analysis using CSERV\n➢ Manual Penetration Testing (Proxy testing and SSL scanning)\n➢ Vulnerability Assessment using Nessus and Retina tools\n\nDECLARATION\nI hereby declare that the above-mentioned information is correct up to my knowledge and I bear\nthe responsibility for the correctness of the above-mentioned particulars.\n\nDate:\nPlace:Bangalore ( G Tejasri)\n\nEDUCATION\n\nB.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering\n\nPondicherry University -  Puducherry, Puducherry\n\nM.Tech in Power Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering\n\nJawaharlal Nehru Technological University\n\nSKILLS\n\nGap Analysis (5 years), Nessus (5 years), Security (5 years), SSL (5 years), testing (5 years)\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nSKILL SET\nDatabases: Oracle &SQL Server\nOperating System: MS-DOS, Windows 98/XP &UNIX, Windows 7\nLanguages: C, C++\nTesting Tools: Q.T.P, Win Runner7.5, Load Runner 9.5\nNetworking: Hands on Experience On Cisco devices, AAA, TACACS, RADIUS, VPNs\nSecurity: Security scans using Nessus and Retina tools, Penetration\ntesting using Proxy and SSL scans, GAP Analysis using CSERV",
