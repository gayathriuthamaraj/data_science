Resolved many critical issues which appreciated by client\n\nBIRT Reports\nBTRAMR0001SYSER.rptdesign (Work order report):\n• My client was using default BTRAMR2 Work order reports. They also use a different work order\nreport in Maximo V4 and V6. The earlier used report have many drawbacks such as\n\nNo Flexibility for modification since it is used by many divisions\nEmpty boxes, lot of missing information\nNot align with Systems objectives and processes\nHistorical context on the asset is missing\nEsthetical issues: Font too small, input fields not instinctive\nNo bar coding used\n• The outcome of this report is a form to support technician's work and regulation and give\nthem simplicity to input information.

It shows count of tickets raised and assigned to\nboth Infosys and Client queue. We can view the total no. of tickets raised for various application\ngroups such as Maximo, Kronos and BIEM. It also further categories the ticket count based on\nticket priority and the status. This helps in analyzing the data from ticketing tool.\n• There might be cases where different teams work on the tickets raised. This reports helps to\nanalyses the team wise ticket count. We can there by monitor the performance of various teams.\n• This report displays the number of Incidents and Service Requests logged in each month. Also\nit shows total tickets (Incidents + Service requests) logged in each month.\n• This Report shows the number of tickets logged per country and it has been grouped month\nwise for various application groups such as Maximo, Kronos and BIEM within a date range.\n\nVend_Reported_hrs. rptdesign (Vendor Reported Hours):\n• This report will fetch the details of vendor type labor working hours for each WOs.\n\nRole: Quality Anchor\n• Working as Quality Anchor for my team, which involves creating defect prevention analysis,\ntracking all the works and auditing for quality\n• Providing Statistics about the monthly activities done by the team\n• From defect prevent analysis focus on specific topic and conducting brainstorming session with\nteam to avoid the defects\n• Responsible for gathering the requirements from Client and participate in Client Conferences.\n• Divide the requirements into various sprints based on the velocity.\n• Distribute the requirements to the team and monitor the development progress and provide\nclarification on the technical/functional requirements.\n• Mentor for the new members joining the team.\n\nOther Job Related Activities:\n\n\n\n• Successfully Completed Training in Design Thinking course and Kronos tool which keeps tracks\non Work force management.\n\nMaximo consultant\n\nInfosys Limited\n\naround 4.8 years)\n• IT professional with 4.4 years of experience in BIRT reporting, application support in IBM MAXIMO\nApplication.\n• IBM Certified MAXIMO ASSET MANAGEMENT, PURCHASE ORDER, PROCUREMENT, PURCHASE\nREQUISITION Professional\n• Submitted Internal tutorial document on Configuration of Hover Dialogs and Its usage in Maximo\nV7.6\n• Worked on various customer requirements and having overall experience with\n➢ Preventive Maintenance\n➢ Maximo automation and implementation\n➢ MBO customizations\n➢ Data Supply chain\n➢ Portals, Workflows Designing\n➢ Reports/Query Creation\n➢ Work order tracking, Invoicing, Purchase order\n➢ Asset Management\n➢ Maximo Integration Framework (MIF)\n➢ Labors, Crews, Security Group Set up\n➢ Domains, Database configuration\n➢ Basics of BIRT, Cognos Reporting, Monitor logs from Admin console.\n➢ Maximo Java customization\n➢ Maximo Installation/Upgradation\n➢ Basic WebSphere function\n\n• Strong interpersonal skills and the ability to work in team efficiently.
