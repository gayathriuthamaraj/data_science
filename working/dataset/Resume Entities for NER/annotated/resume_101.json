IP\nis a packet-based protocol used to exchange data, voice, and video traffic over digital networks\n• Cisco's Wide-Area Application Services IPv4 users can move to IPv6 and receive services such\nas end-to-end security, quality of service (QoS), and globally unique addresses. The IPv6 address\nspace reduces the need for private addresses and Network Address Translation (NAT) processing\nby border routers at network edges.\n• Implementing basic IPv6 connectivity in the Cisco IOS software consists of assigning IPv6\naddresses to individual router interfaces. The forwarding of IPv6 traffic can be enabled globally,\nand Cisco Express Forwarding switching for IPv6 can also be enabled\n• The primary motivation for IPv6 is the need to meet the demand for globally unique IP\naddresses.\n• Mainly involves to checks the functionality of all waas features to work with v6 addressing\n\nPRODUCT IPv6 Support on WAAS (Wide Area Application Services)\n\nPROJECT CISCO-WAAS Express (WEXP)\n\nMember Technical Staff - Automation & Testing\n\nCisco Systems -\n\nJanuary 2013 to December 2013\n\nDURATION Jan-2013 to December-2013\nTEAM SIZE 21\nROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\nMember Technical Staff - Automation & Testing\n• Identified the automatable cases from the test plan.\n• Prepared the HLD document for the automatable cases.\n• Automated test cases for various components on the wexp product for the functionality check.\n• Worked on Config_Sync, HTTP, HTTPS, SSL, SMB_AO component automation.\n• Automated around 200+ cases for various components.\n• Performed regression for all the automated cases through ATS framework with aetest script\ntemplate.\n• Reviewed the automated cases developed by team members.\n• Involved in executing all the automated cases for various releases as Phase1, Phase2 (pi19-25)\nand posted results in TIMS tool.\n• Regression Testing\n• Defect filing in CDETS\n\nLANGUAGE TCL Programming, Python\nRELEASES Phase1 &Phase2 (with 535)\nDESCRIPTION\n• Cisco's Wide-Area Application Services (WAAS) Express feature is a key component of the Cisco\nWAAS product portfolio. WAAS Express is a cost-effective, IOS-based, WAN optimization solution\nthat increases the amount of available bandwidth for small-to-mid-size branch offices and remote\nlocations, while accelerating TCP-based applications that operate in a WAN environment.\n\n\n\n• The Wide-Area Application Services (WAAS) Express software optimizes TCP traffic flows across\na WAN. WAAS Express integrates with native services such as security, NetFlow, and quality of\nservice (QoS). WAAS Express provides the following benefits:\n❖ Bandwidth optimization\n❖ Application acceleration\n❖ Increase in remote user productivity\n❖ Interoperation with existing Cisco WAAS infrastructure\n❖ Network transparency\n❖ Deployment flexibility with on-demand service enablement\n• The Wexp is about the wide Area Application Service on IOS (Router) itself.\n• Mainly involves to checks the functionality of optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS,\nSMB and Config_sync.\n\nPRODUCT WAAS Express(Wide Area Application Services)\n\nPROJECT CISCO-WAAS\nCLIENT Cisco Systems\nORGANISATION HCL Technologies Ltd\n\nSoftware Engineer - Automation & Testing\n\n-\n\nJune 2011 to December 2012\n\n• Identified the automatable cases from the test plan.\n• Prepared the HLD document for the automatable cases.\n• Automated test cases for various components on the waas product for the functionality check.\n• Worked on Plaform, SNMP, SSL, HTTP component automation.\n• Automated around 600+ cases for various components.\n• Performed regression for all the automated cases through ATS framework with aetest script\ntemplate.\n• Active Participation in automating test cases for sanity test.\n• Reviewed the automated cases developed by team members.\n• Involved in executing all the automated cases and reporting bugs/defects.\n• Worked on various releases of the products (Lancer, Phoenix, Skyhawk) for regressing the\nautomated cases and posted results in TIMS tool.\n• Defect filing in CDETS\n\nLANGUAGE TCL Programming, Python\nRELEASES LANCER, PHOENIX, SKYHAWK, SPRIT\nDESCRIPTION\n• Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) is a Cisco Systems technology that improves the\nperformance of applications on a wide area network (WAN). WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area\nFile Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at\nLAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based\napplications on a given network.\n• WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work\ntogether to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt\n\n\n\nto communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so\nthat they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server.\n• The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to\noptimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized\n• Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform\ncheck.\n\nPRODUCT WAAS(Wide Area Application Services)\n\nEDUCATION\n\nB.E in CSE\n\nANNA University\n\n2011\n\nDay Adventist Matric Hr.Sec School\n\n2005 to 2007\n\nSKILLS\n\noptimization (2 years), Python (4 years), router (4 years), TCL (4 years), Testing (4 years)\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nTechnical Skills\nProgramming Languages Python, TCL, Power Query, SQL, Shell Scripting, C#\nConcepts Networking, WAAS (Wan Optimization), WAAS on Router, WAE(Wide Area Engine),\nWCCP Protocol,\nAutomation Framework ATS (Automated Test System), Selenium Testing Framework\nIDE(Integrated Development Environment) Eclipse, Pycharm, Pydev[Plugin for eclipse IDE]\nSoftware\nEclipse CDETS & Rally (Bug Tracking), eARMS (Regression testing), ACME(Versioning),\nTIMS(Reporting), HTMLTestRunner, Power Query(Automation), ARAS PLM(Product Lifecycle\nManagement), AML Studio (adaptive markup language)\n\nOperating Systems Windows XP/10, Linux",
