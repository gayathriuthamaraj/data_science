It is a proprietary platform and has company internal\ncustomers. It has main two planes, system management and system service planes and several\nsub modules.\nI have successfully worked on the following modules.\n\nModule - MML INI Parser Tool\nMML is Configuration Tool used in communication equipments\nThis Configuration Tool has set of default and user defined commands. INI Parsing tool is a tool\nwhich accepts MML Commands in certain grammar and generates Resource file and Binary File\nrespectively which will be read by server to resister the commands.\nInvolved in the development, testing, verification of the module on windows.\n\n\n\nModule - Man Machine Language\nMML is a configuration tool widely used in communication equipments. It uses Client/Server\narchitecture. MML server communicates with both the client and the APP in the equipment.\nIt receives MML commands inputted by users from the client and relays it to APP to process\nit. After acquiring the processing result, the server generates a MML report and sends it back\nto the client. It interacts with other system modules. Connection Management, Authorization\nManagement, Command Process, Data Synchronization, Event Notification, Command Parsing,\nLOG/ALARM Handling are some of the functions of MML Server.\nInvolved in the development, defect fixing and verification of the module on windows, Linux and\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.\n\nModule - Configuration Management\nConfiguration Management Module is core module of System Management. Its main function\nis to define specifications for configuration management interface between the configuration\ntool layer and the application layer, and provide related configuration command communication\nmechanism. Any information that can be modified by the user/application and that affects the\nfunctionality of the application can be regarded as configurable data. All configuration commands\ncan be sent to Configuration Management Module using a common interface type.\nConfiguration Data Management Module is a supplementary optional component that can be\nloaded to provide a persistent storage (&amp; retrieval) mechanism for applications' static\nconfiguration data.\nInvolved in the defect fixing and feature enhancement of the module on windows, Linux and\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.\n\nModule - TL1\nTransaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely used, \"legacy\", management protocol in\ntelecommunications. It is a cross-vendor, cross-technology man-machine language, and is\nwidely used to manage Synchronous Optical Networks (SONET) . It is defined for operation\nsystem/ network element (machine-to-machine) interfaces. TL1 corresponds to the User System\nLanguage (USL), which is the language for human-to machine interactions. It is used for managing\nnetwork elements in a network. TL1 Module is an interface between an Application and Client.\nClient sends the TL1 Commands to perform some configuration operations in the Applications.\nTL1 module process the client text TL1 commands according to standard specification TL1 GR\n831 and interacts with the Configuration management module and Convert Response messages\nback to TL1 Response messages\nInvolved in development, verification and customer and release activities. I was a module lead\nfor this project.\n\nModule - QX\nThe Qx interface is a company proprietary application layer protocol between target and the GUI\nof NMS. By this protocol, NE can communicate with SCC (System Communication and Control)\nsoftware in different operation system. Each command has defined format. Commands are given\nin binary form. Qx Module acts as an interface between the Client and Application.\nInvolved in development, verification and customer and release activities. I was a module lead\nfor this project.\n\nRole: Designer/Developer/ Reviewer/\n\n\n\nResponsibility: Designing and coding various modules Involvement in peer review and overall\nreview activities and project discussions Coordinating the development cycle Training team\nmembers and solving project related issues configuration management of the project using Clear\nCase\nDuration: From June 2004 to Sep 2006\nHardware: X86, CPCI, ATCA\nSoftware: C++, C\nProject2: Wireless LAN - 802.11 MAC (Split AP Architecture)\nDescription of the project\nWireless LAN 802.11 describes MAC and PHY. Wireless stations are connected to form a basic\nservice area which is controlled by a base station called Access Point. Access Point is a special\ndevice which basically acts as a bridge between wired and wireless media connected to a\ndistributed system generally Ethernet. Several Access Points can be connected to a distribution\nmedia to form an extended service set.\nIn split AP architecture AP's connect to a central controller called Access Controller in short\nAC. AP has the minimal functionalities such as receiving the 802.11 data from the radio and\nforwarding data and management frames to AC, Power management, Advertising beacons,\nhandling control frames. Management operations such as Association, Authentication, Handling\nframes, conversion between […] 802.3 will be done by AC.\nI was involved in the development of feature development, defect analysis, testing activities in\nthe CLI, Frame handling, Association and Beacon advertisement modules.\nModule: WLAN Support for WMM 802.11 E Qos Requirements\nWMM is a protocol designed by the Wi-Fi forum to provide quality of service to wireless traffic.\nThis project basically deals with providing WLAN support for WMM module, this includes handling\nQos frames in the Uplink down link data flow, Priority mapping for Qos frames, Fragmentation\nand Reassembly of the Qos frames, Security Related modifications for Qos Frames, Power\nmanagement of Qos stations etc.\nI was involved in the design, review, coding of the Uplink, Down link Data Flow, Fragmentation\nand Reassembly of the Qos frames.\n\nRole: Developer\nResponsibility: To design, and code the necessary changes. Design test scenarios for the design\nverification of the feature enhancements. Ensure proper quality of the product delivered.
