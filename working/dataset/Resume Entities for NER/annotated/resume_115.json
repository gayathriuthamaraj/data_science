I have been using\ncombined engineering principles wherein I was responsible for designing, developing, testing,\ndeploying and monitoring highly scalable distributed applications and services. \n\nWhile I have always been working using Microsoft technologies, I got chance to work for Microsoft\nin as a full-time employee last year. My focus as part of this role was as a Dev Ops/Site Reliability\nEngineer. The main requirement of this role was to keep-lights-on in all data centers for Windows\nDeveloper Center. While Service Engineering aspect was the main requirement, I used my\ntechnical architect and software tools for inside-out and outside-in monitoring and telemetry. \n\nAs a technical architect, I have worked in Accenture for about 7+ years. My role @ Microsoft\naccount was to demonstrate technical leadership, design technical architecture, propose\nand introduce standard design and architectural patterns and practices, incorporate new\nrequirements and feedbacks from client and execute multiple quick prototypes. As part of this\nrole – I architected Microsoft IT’s (MSIT) biggest Platform As A Service (PaaS) solution back in\nthe days.\n\nI have executed multiple client facing projects wherein I was responsible for designing,\narchitecting the compute, storage, application and deployment architecture. I have experience\nin designing and architecting systems for Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCP/\nDR strategies). I have designed and architected solutions for “Testing in production”. I have\nexperience in designing and architecting for extremely high scale (~ 3 billion requests/day). I\nhave designed and implemented auto healing, smooth traffic routing and eventual consistency\nin multiple client facing projects. \n\nI am in the Information Technology industry since 2001 working for various software organizations\nin India for 4 years till I joined Accenture in 2006. I came to USA in 2010 and was working as\nconsultant for Microsoft. I joined Microsoft in May 2015 as a full-time employee. I earned my\nElectronics Engineering degree in year 2000, Diploma in Advance Computing degree in year 2001\nand completed Microsoft Certified Professional Developer and Enterprise Architect certification\n(MCPDEA) in year 2007. I am also Microsoft Azure Certified Developer and Architect. \n\nI am frequent community contributor. I blog at http://girishthegeek.wordpress.com/ \n\nI have worked and published an asset called Framework for Ops Team considering Windows Azure\nand it was very well received by the clients and appreciated by the managers.\n\nI wrote a white paper related to AppFabric Service Bus which got published in MSDN.\n\nWilling to relocate: Anywhere\n\nhttps://www.indeed.com/r/Girish-Acharya/6757f94ee9f4ec23?isid=rex-download&ikw=download-top&co=IN\n\n\nWORK EXPERIENCE\n\nTechnical Architect\n\nAccenture Services -  Pune, Maharashtra\n\nSoftware Engineer 2\n\nMicrosoft -  Redmond -\n\nJune 2016 to February 2017\n\nEngagement and monetization (Microsoft – Universal Store/Windows Developer Center)\nJune 2016– Recently \n\n〓 Technologies used:\nMicrosoft Azure, C#, SQL, PowerShell, App Insights, Azure Data Factory, Redis Cache, API\nManagement Gateway, Azure App Services, Akamai, Azure CDNs, Azure Traffic Manager,\nAutomated Unit Testing, Web Testing, Coded Unit Tests, Performance Testing etc. Tools – SpecFlow,\nJMeter, Junit, NUNit, MoQ, Fluent Assertions, VSTS, GIT, Microsoft Test Manager, Continuous\nIntegration and deployment, maintaining build definitions \n\n〓 Roles Played:\n\no Technical architect \no Designing and architecting for compute, storage, application, security and deployment\narchitecture \no Designing and architecting for Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCP DR)\no Designing and architecting for the Testing In Production (TIP)\no Designing and architecting for auto healing and auto scaling pattern \no Designing and developing for monitoring \n〓 Design and develop inside out and outside in monitoring and logging \n〓 Design and develop synthetic web tests\n〓 Design and develop watchdogs \no Design and develop the global traffic management using Akamai \no Keeping lights on for the services in all data centers \no Firefighting drills and actual firefighting \no Live site issue tracking, management, coordination and resolving \no Capacity monitoring and management \no Code reviews \no Implemented the security architecture\n\nEDUCATION\n\nBachelor of Engineering in Microsoft\n\nC-DAC\n\n\n\nSKILLS\n\nAzure (8 years), Asp.Net (8 years), C# (9 years), Web API (6 years), Sql (6 years), Technical\nArchitect (5 years), Automation Testing (5 years)\n\nLINKS\n\nhttp://girishthegeek.wordpress.com/\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/girishazure\n\nCERTIFICATIONS/LICENSES\n\nMicrosoft Certified Professional Developer\n\nMicrosoft Certified Professional Developer\n\nMicrosoft Certified Enterprise Architect\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nTechnical Expertise\n\n*Technical Architecture, Microsoft Azure Platform, Microsoft .NET Platform, C#, ASP.NET*\n\n* Designing/Architecting/Building/Testing/Deploying apps/APIs using Windows Azure, SQL Azure,\nAzure Storage, REST/WCF, AppFabric Cache, Service Bus, Topic and Subscription, Access Control\nServices from last 7 years.\n* Azure Application Architecture: Web Role, Worker Role, VM Role, admin mode, start-up tasks\nintegrating with on premise services using App Fabric Service Bus\n* Azure Security Architecture: Web Role security using SSL, WCF Security using certificates,\nData Encryption using certificates, Authentication using ADFS/STS, Single sign on using ACS.\nParticipated in ACE reviews, and provisioned related documentation/code\n* Azure Operations Architecture: Logging and monitoring using Windows Azure Diagnostics,\nintegration with AVICode, SCOM, disaster recovering and business continuity planning and\nimplementation, automated builds and deployments.\n* Azure Data Architecture: Understands SQL Azure, Windows Azure Storage (Tables, Blobs,\nQueues), Document DB, SQL Azure Data Sync, SQL Azure Federation etc.\n* Deployment Architecture: Continuous integration and deployment.
